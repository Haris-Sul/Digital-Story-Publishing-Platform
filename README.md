# Digital Story Publishing Platform

[YouTube Demo](https://youtu.be/YeZLmRGNSxw)

In our Software Engineering module in teams we undertook an agile project where we developed this site using Ruby with the Sinatra framework, an SQLite database and Rspec for automated testing.

This platform lets users switch between reader and writer mode where they can buy stories to read with monthly credits or publish their own to earn more, along with many other features including:

- Account creation + login
- Browse + buy stories page 
- Purchasing membership + extra credits ("popcorns")
- Dashboards showing owned + published stories
- Writing and updating stories
- Settings, metrics, support tickets and reporting content
- Staff can manage accounts, content and promotions
<br>
Alongside spearheading the sites styling and database design, these are the core features I developed: 

- Browse + buy stories page ("Discover Stories")
    - Providing advanced sorting + filtering options
-  Users owned stories ("My Library")
    - With the subscribe feature + unread notification 
- Admin Panel for managing user accounts and content
    - Searching for users + updating credits
    - Maintaining referential integrity for deletion of users, stories and polls
